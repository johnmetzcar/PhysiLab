# PhysiBoSS Tutorial Jupyter Notebook 

In this folder we provide a few jupyter notebooks which analyse either the intracellular Boolean models or the PhysiBoSS models. 

## Available notebooks

CellFate_Analysis.ipynb : Analysis of the Calzone's cell fate model. 

Cell_cycle_boolean_analysis.ipynb : Analysis of the results of the cell cycle intracellular model

Cell_cycle_analysis.ipynb : Analysis of the results of the cell cycle PhysiBoSS model


## Running the notebooks

To install dependencies, you can use conda and run :

`conda env create --file environment.yml`

and then activate your environment with :

`conda activate tutorial-notebooks`

Finally, you can run Jupyter Lab and open the notebooks :

`jupyter-lab`
